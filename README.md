# Some devnotes

This app is currently a mess codewise and it needs a rewrite.

It was first created back in 2013 and it basically has been my personal "test
bench" for whatever new web tech I happened to be interested at any given
time. For example in early 2014 I re-wrote it with this new tech called
"Reactjs" which was released less than year ago at the time.

Surprisingly it's still written with React but uses very weird combination of
legacy React libs and coding styles:

-   Mix of classes and hooks
-   Uses weird Redux abstraction lib with too many HOCs
-   Uses two different css-in-js libs which is pretty awesome
-   Is only partly migrated to TypeScript

In spring 2020 I half-assed it to run it on latest Next.js (it was using
Gatsby) so it could be easily deployed using the free [zeit.co] plan.

It also means it's not too bad to get running. Get node.js 12 and type
following

    git clone git@github.com:skydivejkl/hyppykeli.fi.git
    cd hyppykeli.fi
    npm ci
    npm run dev
